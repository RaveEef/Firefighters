This is the fireFighters_MAS model. It was developed for the Multi-Agent Systems course at Maastricht University, by Kirill Tumanov in 2015.
It forms a basic structure of the wildfire simulation, and allows students to focus on development of MAS concepts.
Some inspiration was taken from the students, who took the course over the years, and the model was adjusted accordingly.
